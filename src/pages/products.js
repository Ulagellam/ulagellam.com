              Neetling incorporates the scientifically proven learning technique
              called spaced repetition which optimizes study time, improves
              long-term retention of study material and keeps NEET prep
              stress-free.
            </p>
            <p>
              This method fights the forgetting curve by exposing you to the
              material repeatedly over increased intervals to keep information
              fresh and accessible. With spaced repetition, you're not
              memorizing; you're mastering the content.

            <h2>Facial Recognition</h2>
            <p>
              Facial recognition technology is a form of biometric
              identification that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze
              and compare facial features. It works by capturing an image or
              video of a face and then analyzing specific features, such as the
              distance between the eyes, the shape of the jawline, and the
              contour of the cheekbones.
            </p>
            <p>
              Facial recognition technology is widely used in security
              applications, such as surveillance cameras, access control
              systems, and border control. It can also be used in law
              enforcement to identify suspects or missing persons. Moreover,
              facial recognition technology is commonly used for personal device
              unlocking, such as unlocking smartphones and laptops.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the key advantages of facial recognition technology is that
              it is non-invasive and can be used at a distance, making it an
              ideal tool for security and surveillance purposes. However, it has
              also been subject to criticism and controversy, particularly
              around privacy concerns and potential misuse. In response, some
              organizations have developed ethical guidelines for the use of
              facial recognition technology to ensure it is used appropriately
              and responsibly.
