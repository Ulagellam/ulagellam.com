I also created a gift for my sister using React. The main feature of the\\npresent is a video that contains a rickroll. When the rickroll plays, it should\\nenable a previously disabled button.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\n:::caution\\n\\nNote: This tutorial assumes you have a react-ts or react app with vite included.\\nSo, if you don\'t have the project up and running, please visit\\n[the Vite docs](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project).\\n\\n:::\\n\\n## Step 1: Add a video to `App.tsx`.\\n\\nYou can include a video using the HTML `<video>` tag.\\n\\nHere\'s an example:\\n\\n```tsx title=\\"/src/App.tsx\\" showLineNumbers\\nimport rickRoll from \\"./rickroll.mp4\\";\\nimport \\"./App.css\\";\\n\\nfunction App() {\\n  return (\\n    <>\\n      <div>\\n        <video src={rickRoll} width=\\"750\\" height=\\"500\\" controls></video>\\n      </div>\\n    </>\\n  );\\n}\\n\\nexport default App;\\n```\\n\\nIn this code, make sure to place the video file (rickroll.mp4) in the public\\nfolder.\\n\\n## Step 2: Adding Refs\\n\\nIf you\'re new to React and aren\'t familiar with what a ref is, think of it as a\\nway to reference an element similar to `document.querySelector` in vanilla\\nJavaScript.\\n\\nIn React, using refs is considered a best practice instead of directly using\\n`document.` functions.\\n\\nLet\'s add refs to our video tag:\\n\\n```tsx title=\\"/src/App.tsx\\" showLineNumbers\\nimport { createRef } from \\"react\\";\\nimport rickRoll from \\"./rickroll.mp4\\";\\nimport \\"./App.css\\";\\n\\nfunction App() {\\n  const videoRef = createRef<HTMLVideoElement>();\\n\\n  return (\\n    <>\\n      <div>\\n        <video\\n          src={rickRoll}\\n          width=\\"750\\"\\n          height=\\"500\\"\\n          ref={videoRef}\\n          controls\\n        ></video>\\n      </div>\\n    </>\\n  );\\n}\\n\\nexport default App;\\n```\\n\\nIn the updated code, we import the createRef function from React. We create a\\nref using `createRef<HTMLVideoElement>()` and assign it to `videoRef`.\\n\\nWe then use `ref={videoRef}` to attach the ref to the video element. With refs,\\nyou can access the underlying DOM element using `videoRef.current`.\\n\\nTo play or pause the video, you can use the following code:\\n\\n- Play: `videoRef.current?.play()`\\n- Pause: `videoRef.current?.pause()`\\n\\nThe ? is used to safely access the play() and pause() methods, as the current\\nmight be null initially.\\n\\n## Step 3. Adding `onTimeUpdate`\\n\\nThe `<video>` tag in HTML has an attribute called `onTimeUpdate` which allows us\\nto set a function that will be called whenever the timestamp in the video\\nchanges.\\n\\nIn this step, we will create a function called `handleTimeUpdate` to handle this\\nevent and perform certain actions when the target timestamp is reached.\\n\\nTo retrieve the current timestamp, we can use the following code snippet:\\n\\n```tsx\\nconst currentTime = videoRef.current?.currentTime || 0;\\n```\\n\\nHere is an example `handleTimeUpdate` function that we can use:\\n\\n```tsx\\nconst handleTimeUpdate = () => {\\n  const currentTime = videoRef.current?.currentTime || 0;\\n  setTimestamp(currentTime);\\n  if (currentTime >= targetTimestamp && !didRickRollCome) {\\n    videoRef[\\"current\\"].pause();\\n    setDidRickRollCome(true);\\n  }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nAnd in the HTML you need to add the `onTimeUpdate` attribute:\\n\\n```tsx\\n<video\\n  src={rickRoll}\\n  width=\\"750\\"\\n  height=\\"500\\"\\n  ref={videoRef}\\n  onTimeUpdate={handleTimeUpdate}\\n  controls\\n></video>\\n```\\n\\nBy stitching all that code, we get the final result,\\n\\n```tsx title=\\"/src/App.tsx\\" showLineNumbers\\nimport { useState, createRef } from \\"react\\";\\nimport rickRoll from \\"/rickroll.mp4\\";\\nimport \\"./App.css\\";\\n\\nfunction App() {\\n  const targetTimestamp = 6;\\n  const [timestamp, setTimestamp] = useState(0);\\n  const [didRickRollCome, setDidRickRollCome] = useState(false);\\n\\n  const videoRef = createRef<HTMLVideoElement>();\\n  const handleTimeUpdate = () => {\\n    const currentTime = videoRef.current?.currentTime || 0;\\n    setTimestamp(currentTime);\\n    if (currentTime >= targetTimestamp && !didRickRollCome) {\\n      onTimestamp();\\n    }\\n  };\\n\\n  const onTimestamp = () => {\\n    // When the timestamp is at 6 seconds do this:\\n    videoRef.current?.pause();\\n    setDidRickRollCome(true);\\n  };\\n  return (\\n    <>\\n      <div>\\n        <p>The Video is at {timestamp} seconds</p>\\n        {didRickRollCome ? <p>Passed {targetTimestamp} seconds!</p> : null}\\n        <video\\n          src={rickRoll}\\n          width=\\"750\\"\\n          height=\\"500\\"\\n          ref={videoRef}\\n          onTimeUpdate={handleTimeUpdate}\\n          controls\\n        ></video>\\n      </div>\\n    </>\\n  );\\n}\\n\\nexport default App;\\n```\\n\\n:::note\\n\\nI have added this code so it will show the current timestamp and if it touched\\nthe `targetTimestamp` var in the UI:\\n\\n```\\n<p>The Video is at {timestamp} seconds</p>;\\n{\\n\\tdidRickRollCome ? <p>Passed {targetTimestamp} seconds!</p> : null;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n:::\\n\\nThe `handleTimeUpdate` function retrieves the current timestamp from\\n`videoRef.current?.currentTime` with a default value of 0. It updates the\\ntimestamp state with `setTimestamp(currentTime)`.\\n\\nIf the current timestamp is at least the target timestamp and the Rickroll\\nhasn\'t occurred, it pauses the video with and sets `didRickRollCome` to true\\n\\n## Extra Step (If you are using React with JS)\\n\\nIn Step 2, you will need to change this:\\n\\n```tsx\\n// Line No. 6\\nconst videoRef = createRef<HTMLVideoElement>();\\n```\\n\\nto\\n\\n```jsx\\nconst videoRef = createRef();\\n```\\n\\nWe are doing that as, Javascript does not support types.\\n\\nAlso, the file extension should be `.jsx` instead of `.tsx`\\n\\n# Results\\n\\nGithub (containing both react and react-ts):\\n[Stop At Sec](https://github.com/Sivayogeith/stop-at-sec)\\n\\nDemo (I have hosted only react as it is the same as react-ts):\\n[GH Pages](https://sivayogeith.github.io/stop-at-sec/)\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nReact\'s JSX syntax is similar to HTML, but when working with React, it\'s\\nrecommended to use refs instead of directly manipulating the DOM with\\n`document.` functions.\\n\\nIn this tutorial, we covered how to add a video to a React component using the\\n`<video>` tag, how to use refs to reference the video element, and how to access\\nand control the video using the ref.\\n\\nI hope this tutorial has been helpful in your React journey!\\n\\nAnd If you want to see the present I gave to my sister, give me an DM on Discord\\n([thecodingsage#8758](https://discord.com/users/1061949717833068607))\\n\\nHappy coding!"},{"id":"how-i-learned-MEAN-in-a-week","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/how-i-learned-MEAN-in-a-week","editUrl":"https://github.com/Ulagellam/ulagellam.com/tree/main/blog/2023-03-03-how-i-learned-MEAN-in-a-week.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-03-03-how-i-learned-MEAN-in-a-week.md","title":"How I learned MEAN in a week!","description":"Learning MEAN stack development in a week was a challenging but rewarding experience.","date":"2023-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"mean","permalink":"/blog/tags/mean"},{"inline":true,"label":"angular","permalink":"/blog/tags/angular"},{"inline":true,"label":"mongodb","permalink":"/blog/tags/mongodb"},{"inline":true,"label":"express","permalink":"/blog/tags/express"},{"inline":true,"label":"nodejs","permalink":"/blog/tags/nodejs"}],"readingTime":1.825,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Sivayogeith Umamaheswaran","title":"CTO, Ulagellam","url":"https://github.com/sivayogeith","imageURL":"/img/sivayogeith.jpg","key":"sivayogeith","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"how-i-learned-MEAN-in-a-week","title":"How I learned MEAN in a week!","authors":"sivayogeith","tags":["mean","angular","mongodb","express","nodejs"],"image":"./blog-images/mean-stack.jpeg","description":"Learning MEAN stack development in a week was a challenging but rewarding experience.","enableComments":true},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"How to Pause a Video at a Specific Second","permalink":"/blog/pausing-video-specific-second-guide"}},"content":"![MEAN Stack](./blog-images/mean-stack.jpeg)\\n\\nAs a developer with some experience in Node.js and Angular, I was interested in\\nlearning how to build full-stack applications using the MEAN stack.
